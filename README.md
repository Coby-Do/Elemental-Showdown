## Features

1. **User Options**: Hovering over an element icon reveals a CSS hover animation. Clicking on an icon registers a player move, and the game displays the winner's results.

2. **CPU**: After the user selects an element, the CPU randomly selects a move based on the user's choice, avoiding duplicate element choices.

3. **Scoreboard**: Designed using HTML and CSS, the scoreboard updates based on the user vs. CPU outcomes. Win, lose, and tie conditions are evaluated using switch statements.

4. **Reset Button**: Easily accessible on the top-right corner of the screen, the reset button lights up when hovered over and resets the scoreboard when clicked.

5. **Balancing Chart**: A visual chart created with Canva explains win, lose, and draw conditions. A pop-up box appears upon selecting the chart, detailing how each element counteracts others.
